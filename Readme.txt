Uploaded Files & their contents:1) Xtern_AI_Assignment_Dhanyan.pdf contains the answers to Questions 1,2 and 42) File_to_create_pickle.ipynb: This keeps only the bare minimum code to train random forest classifier (found to be the most effective for our case through EDA) in the most optimal way and to save the trained model as a pickle file in the local system. Please mention the correct path of the input csv file3) Data Preparation Function.ipynb: This file contains all the data preparation steps involved written as one consolidated function. 4) Process Overview – FoodX Multi-class Classifier.pdf: This file describes the project’s objective, lists the methods that can work and explains the rationale behind choosing Random Forest Classifier as the ideal one. 5) EDA and rough work.ipynb: This python file has all the EDA and rough work done in the process of arriving at ‘File_to_create_pickle’Note: I couldn’t upload my local pickle file to Github due to memory restrictions. I request the evaluator to run ‘File_to_create_pickle.ipynb’ in their local system to create a local copy of the ML model pickle.
